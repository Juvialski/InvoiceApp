## Authoritative current baseline

UI/UX Round 2 was implemented from `main` at:

`746a4aacda9ccceff88a5093bfeb678b8b1046a8`

The final application-bearing implementation head before documentation-only finalization was:

`486d8cd594eade2ad6399ed3160b6f0a227a17b8`

That exact application head passed the protected application/build, browser/demo, and workflow-map checks applicable to this phase. The protected database workflow correctly fast-passed after classifying the diff as database-unaffected. Documentation-only finalization commits may advance the PR head without changing the reviewed application code.

The last application-bearing SHA currently covered by the earlier successful hosted application certification remains:

`e4ee4ebde489629ee74429b4e37abb511943a51e`

That hosted evidence belongs to the earlier certified application state and must not be generalized blindly to the newer UI/UX Round 2 application code.

## UI/UX Round 2 — completed 2026-09-13

The user approved a second broad usability phase and allowed navigation/tab restructuring when that improved and simplified the product without weakening important features, permissions, financial truth, audit history, source ownership, or workflow correctness.

PR #161 completed that phase.

### Final implementation state

The implementation delivers grouped authenticated shell navigation, shared task-first controls/disclosures, mandatory Documents/Expenses/Project Allocation/Payroll improvements, and targeted hierarchy changes for Dashboard, Supplier Invoices, Projects, Warehouse, Equipment, and Settings. The changes preserve the existing route vocabulary, deep-link query contracts, permission checks, source ownership, financial boundaries, immutable history, and Assistant confirmation model. No database migration or schema contract changed.

The mandatory regression areas were explicitly rechecked:

- **Project Allocation** uses readable responsive allocation views so large values, units, remaining amounts, and selection/action semantics are no longer forced into one narrow row.
- **Documents** is search/list-first and keeps common open/preview/handoff work ahead of secondary registry/provenance framing.
- **Expenses** keeps the Expense register primary while Supplier Invoice/source documents remain supporting context and the linked Expense retains payable/cost authority.
- **Payroll** is grouped around Overview, People, Attendance & Time, Payroll Runs, and Imports & Setup instead of the former flat equal-priority tab strip.

The final authenticated Local-QA route matrix recorded **59/59 PASS** with zero page-overflow, dialog-overflow, or interactive-overflow failures. The recorded authenticated visual-certification pass produced **80 route/state captures across desktop, constrained laptop, tablet, and phone, plus corrected Projects captures at desktop/tablet/phone**. Exact-head GitHub browser QA independently captured 78 demo screenshots/scenarios across 34 routes and four viewport classes with zero failed scenarios, navigation failures, console errors, page errors, failed requests, or overflow failures.

The focused template/UI/harness suite passed 38/38. At the final application-bearing implementation head, `test:affected:agent` selected 871 tests with 870 pass, 0 fail, and 1 skipped; lint and production build passed. Workflow Map/source consistency passed. No database migration/RLS/RPC/trigger change or production write occurred.

### Document Templates capability truth

The critical Document Templates investigation traced Starter, Upload, and AI persistence through the shared server Storage path. After the private `SUPABASE_STORAGE_SERVER_KEY` was configured locally, the restarted authenticated Local-QA capability endpoint returned `templateStorage.status=AVAILABLE`.

Purchase Order and Client Invoice Starter plus safe Upload each:

- persisted immutable template metadata/version records;
- survived Settings refresh;
- returned retrievable DOCX bytes.

The Starter generator now emits the declared `company.vatTin` tag so activation validation is `VALID`.

Real authenticated Local-QA AI-template evidence is now obtained separately from Storage. `/api/deployment/company-ai` returned HTTP 200 with `runtimeCapability.status=AVAILABLE` while persisted `lastTestStatus` remained `NOT_TESTED`; no credential material was returned. The HSC Purchase Order Analyze request returned `aiStatus=AVAILABLE` with model `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`. The reviewed UI Prepare action created a VALID immutable `DUPLICATED` descendant from the uploaded HSC version, preserved the original SHA, and Test DOCX rendered both synthetic lines. The separate Generate with AI Settings workflow passed for Purchase Order and Client Invoice, persisted VALID AI drafts, survived refresh, downloaded AI DOCX artifacts, and their Test DOCX outputs rendered both synthetic lines.

High-fidelity company-template PDF conversion remains independently `UNAVAILABLE`. The existing programmatic PDF fallback remains a separate capability.

The broad Local-QA route matrix still needs separate harness cleanup/reconciliation because its long sweep recorded unrelated route/session failures; the isolated authenticated AI/template workflow passed. This is pre-merge QA evidence, not hosted exact-SHA release certification.

No secret was returned to the browser. No uncontrolled email/SMS send and no production mutation occurred.

### Standing UI baseline

Later product phases must preserve the completed workflow-first rules:

- task first, system architecture second;
- keep important functionality while reducing cognitive load;
- one obvious primary action per context;
- actual working content/register before long explanations or oversized summary regions;
- progressive disclosure for provenance, audit metadata, raw IDs, and advanced/rare actions;
- business-facing wording instead of engineering/source-of-truth jargon in ordinary UI;
- compact useful summaries and filters;
- consistent page/action/filter/table/form/navigation grammar;
- routes/deep links remain compatible wherever practical;
- responsive layouts may reorganize workflows rather than merely shrinking desktop layouts;
- simplification must never weaken permissions, financial truth, audit history, source ownership, company isolation, or Assistant confirmation boundaries.

## Immediate corrective phase — Document Template AI Auto-Tagging + AI Capability Correction

The user explicitly inserted this corrective phase before Wave 4D resumes. Its design is `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-13-document-template-ai-autotagging-design.md`.

The implementation corrects the stale deployment `lastTestStatus` gate by exposing a server-derived company AI runtime capability from the same resolver used by Analyze/Generate. It also adds deterministic server-owned anchors, allowlisted mapping validation, in-app `Prepare template`, repeating-row tagging, immutable descendant version creation, and safe provider-error wording. Original uploaded bytes remain unchanged; activation remains separate.

Focused local implementation evidence obtained so far:

- capability, DOCX anchor, mapping, transformer, immutable-version, UI-contract, AI-error, compatibility, storage-boundary, security-boundary, and company-AI tests pass;
- TypeScript lint passes;
- local DB-runtime checks remain skipped when their explicit runtime flag is absent;
- no hosted/provider AI certification, production mutation, or uncontrolled email/SMS send has occurred.

The corrective branch is merged into the current baseline. Its real authenticated non-production AI/template runtime evidence remains valid, while hosted exact-SHA certification, production authorization, and high-fidelity PDF conversion remain separate and incomplete.

## Wide Documents Phase — Slice 1 implemented 2026-09-14

The user explicitly reprioritized the next product work to the Wide Documents Phase. Slice 1 makes Documents the central application entry point for document discovery and supported creation without creating a duplicate business-record owner.

The current implementation provides:

- `/documents` as the default Library view;
- durable `/documents?view=library|create|templates` navigation with invalid values defaulting to Library;
- permission-filtered Library projection over existing Purchase Order, Client Invoice, Supplier Invoice, Expense receipt, Bank statement, and Engineering Document sources;
- compact common search/type filters plus progressive project, counterparty, module, origin, and status filters;
- business-language Create links to existing owning workflows, with payroll and engineering options permission-filtered;
- explicit preparation-required states for Warranty Certificate, Equipment / Materials Checklist, and general company uploads rather than fake generators;
- full existing template administration discoverable at Documents -> Templates;
- a small Settings -> Documents template link instead of a competing full template-management surface.

No database, RLS, RPC, Storage, financial, payroll, or provider contract changed in Slice 1. The original owning record routes, Email/SMS handoffs, template capability gates, and existing source-history boundaries remain intact.

The exact next implementation slice is template-first managed document generation for the three supplied HSC DOCX fixtures. It must generalize the allowlisted merge context, preserve the original bytes and warranty wording, support repeating PO/checklist rows, and add structured managed-document data only where a genuine ownership gap is proven. The full Wide Documents Phase remains incomplete.

## Exact next product phase after the Wide Documents Phase — Wave 4D messaging-provider integration/completion

Wave 4D remains **partially implemented but not complete**. Resume it only after the Wide Documents Phase is genuinely complete; do not rebuild the existing Email/SMS workspace or Slice 1 Documents shell.

Approved provider direction remains:

- **Company SIM Gateway — primary/recommended**;
- **PhilSMS — optional hosted Philippine fallback**.

The next implementation should:

- inspect the live Wave 4D contract, current provider-neutral SMS scaffolding, delivery-intent/history model, Gmail implementation, permissions, and completed task-first Email/SMS/Documents UI before changing code;
- implement or finish the approved server-side provider path without exposing provider credentials to the browser;
- preserve one reviewed transactional recipient per SMS send and human review/confirmation before consequential outbound sends;
- keep SMS truthfully unavailable/unverified until controlled provider-backed runtime QA succeeds;
- preserve inbound Gmail intake and existing issued-document Gmail delivery/history behavior;
- reconnect/certify Gmail as needed for exact-state provider evidence rather than assuming old authorization is current;
- preserve append-only/company-bound delivery history, idempotency/reconciliation boundaries, and source document ownership;
- keep AI/provider prerequisites separately truthful; the exercised QA runtime is now available while hosted/provider/release evidence remains separate from Storage and PDF converter truth;
- preserve the completed UI/UX Round 2 hierarchy while adding provider capability;
- close the remaining Wave 4D provider/AI/recovery/readiness evidence before any Worker Registration work.

Worker Registration remains paused and must not be suggested as the immediate next phase.

## Completed quality/application context that remains valid

### First comprehensive Local-QA UI/UX pass — complete

PR #150 previously established broad authenticated route/responsive coverage and fixed concrete UI issues. UI/UX Round 2 then raised the bar from structural correctness to workflow clarity and information hierarchy.

### Programmatic PDF visual certification — complete

Programmatic Purchase Order / Client Invoice fallback output received deliberate visual certification, including centering, logos, long values, multi-page behavior, totals, signatures, and preview/download byte identity for exercised records.

Company-template high-fidelity conversion remains a separate capability and must not be falsely represented as certified when converter support is unavailable.

### Functional Local-QA sweep — complete for supported/fixture-backed workflows

The integrated Local-QA sweep exercises key RFQ/PO/Warehouse, supplier payable, client receivable, payroll, Documents->Compose, stale-record, and Document Templates Starter/Upload persistence/retrieval flows. Subcontract settlement remains fixture-blocked where no safe fixture exists. The isolated authenticated AI/template workflow now passes separately; the broad harness still needs route/session cleanup before an overall PASS claim.

### Supplier Payables Settlement Truth & Consistency — complete

Merged PR #158 established and certified the corrected supplier settlement model:

- the verified linked Expense is the supplier payable/settlement authority even when intentionally `DRAFT`;
- generic direct DRAFT Expense settlement remains ineligible;
- payment state comes from confirmed Cash & Banking evidence, not OCR/document-reported `amountPaid`;
- legacy invoice-target evidence projects through the linked Expense relationship;
- reversal restores outstanding while preserving history;
- project/source linkage and cost truth remain intact.

Do not weaken those semantics during Wave 4D or later UI work.

## Hosted exact-SHA QA evidence

Earlier hosted-certified application SHA:

`e4ee4ebde489629ee74429b4e37abb511943a51e`

At that certification:

- Render QA served the exact intended SHA;
- QA deployment identity/environment matched expectations;
- QA Supabase was independently distinct from production;
- repository and QA migration parity matched `20260912082656_supplier_payables_settlement_consistency`;
- email/password authentication persisted;
- protected route contracts passed;
- zero console/page/network failures were recorded on the successful hosted attempt;
- authenticated engineering-document Storage upload/read/hash/cleanup passed;
- separate supplier-payables QA assertions passed;
- synthetic financial certification fixtures were rolled back/cleaned;
- no uncontrolled email or SMS was sent.

That hosted evidence belongs to that earlier application SHA. The newer UI/UX Round 2 application code has strong Local-QA and exact-head CI/browser evidence, but still needs later hosted exact-SHA evidence before release-readiness claims can move forward.

---

## Current provider / optional capability truth

### Gmail

Exact-state hosted provider proof may require reauthorization. Compose/review remains separate from uncontrolled send. Wave 4D must preserve the human review/confirmation boundary.

### SMS

Approved provider direction remains:

- Company SIM Gateway — primary/recommended;
- PhilSMS — optional hosted fallback.

Provider implementation/completion is now the **next active product phase**. Real SMS remains unavailable/unverified until controlled provider-backed QA succeeds.

### Company-template Storage / AI / conversion

- Starter and safe Upload Storage authority is **AVAILABLE and locally certified** for Purchase Order and Client Invoice persistence/retrieval.
- Real authenticated Local-QA AI template generation is **PASSED for the exercised QA workflow**: runtime capability AVAILABLE, HSC Analyze AVAILABLE, immutable Prepare VALID, Test DOCX passed, and Purchase Order/Client Invoice Generate + persist + refresh + download + Test DOCX passed. Hosted exact-SHA certification remains separate.
- Programmatic PDF fallback is separate and already certified for exercised records.
- Company-template high-fidelity converter-backed PDF remains independently `UNAVAILABLE`.

Do not collapse these four capability states into one generic template/PDF/AI status.

### Subcontract settlement

Remains fixture-limited/not-tested where no safe subcontract/claim fixture exists.

---

## QA / production boundary

`QA CERTIFICATION: NOT READY`

The hosted application and supplier-payables evidence are strong but narrower than full readiness. UI/UX Round 2 adds strong pre-merge authenticated Local-QA and exact-head CI/browser evidence, but the newer application-bearing state is not yet a replacement for hosted exact-SHA certification.

Overall QA remains not ready because remaining provider/readiness limitations still exist, including incomplete Wave 4D provider-backed runtime evidence.

Production is read-only unless the user separately and explicitly authorizes a production operation under the migration/operator policy.

Never infer production authorization from:

- a green PR;
- a merge;
- a Render deployment;
- local QA success;
- hosted QA success;
- documentation changes.

---

## Permanent financial / security / history invariants

Preserve throughout resumed Wave 4D and subsequent work:

- one deployment -> one client company;
- active membership, RLS, RBAC, capability-based authorization, and company isolation;
- Supplier Invoice evidence remains distinct from authoritative linked Expense payable/cost truth;
- Client Invoice/Collection receivable truth remains distinct from Cash & Banking settlement evidence;
- Actual Cost remains distinct from Committed Cost;
- `projects.contract_value` remains distinct from `projects.project_budget`;
- original currency remains explicit and mixed currencies are not silently summed;
- payroll privacy, calculation freshness, approval authority, and settlement history remain intact;
- Purchase Order receiving/close rules remain intact;
- inventory movement/allocation history remains authoritative/explainable;
- immutable issued/finalized document snapshots and provenance remain intact;
- delivery history remains append-only/company-bound;
- Assistant consequential actions retain `prepare -> review -> human confirm -> execute`;
- provider capability states remain truthful when unavailable/unverified;
- completed UI/UX simplification is never authorization simplification.

## Required sequence from this handoff

1. **Wide Documents Phase — ACTIVE; complete the HSC/template-first and managed-document slices**
2. **Wave 4D messaging-provider integration/completion and remaining provider/AI/recovery/readiness evidence**
3. **Worker Registration — PAUSED until Wave 4D complete and user explicitly resumes it**
4. Site Attendance
5. Face Recognition only after design/privacy/security work
6. Final pre-production security/data-integrity certification

Do not skip directly to Worker Registration.

## Fresh implementation handoff instructions

For the next Wide Documents implementation run, Codex should:

- first fetch and fast-forward `main`, record the resulting exact SHA once, and branch from it;
- read `AGENTS.md`, the efficiency guide, active roadmap, this handoff, `docs/HYDROQUALISENSE_UNIFIED_DOCUMENT_CENTER.md`, the current Wide Documents design/plan, and the Wave 4A/template contract;
- read the completed UI/UX Round 2 design record only as needed to preserve the new interaction baseline;
- default to zero subagents, hard maximum two concurrent bounded Codex subagents;
- use at most one bounded context packet when useful;
- inspect the existing Documents shell, template registry/engine, Storage authority, source-backed register, project/engineering document contracts, report/XLSX generators, and permission surfaces before designing changes;
- preserve the actual supplied HSC DOCX files as layout/content fixtures and keep official Word output template-first;
- preserve source-backed ownership and do not add a generic document truth merely to populate the Library;
- run focused -> affected -> relevant build/browser/template-fidelity validation;
- use Docker/Supabase only if the change genuinely crosses DB/security/integrity contracts;
- review the complete final diff;
- synchronize roadmap/handoff/client-facing feature truth to actual final capability;
- push/open PR and stop; Codex must not merge its own PR.

## Stop boundary

Do not let resumed Wave 4D expand into Worker Registration, Site Attendance, Face Recognition, broad CRM, new accounting policy, or unrelated DB redesign.

Complete the Wide Documents Phase and then certify the approved messaging-provider work. Worker Registration remains paused until Wave 4D is genuinely complete and the user explicitly resumes it.
